How it works?
1. You login into the system.
2. You input the data of your client to find out if he/she is a criminal or PEP. Data goes to the database.
3. System will return maximum 3 candidates with similar characteristics.
4. User needs to go one by one and decide if that's the person.
All of user's decisions along with the user's comment will be place into the database.
5. At the end of the process, user will see summary page.
